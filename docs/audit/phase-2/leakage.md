# Phase 2 - Data Integrity and Leakage (Completed 2025-10-19)

## Objective
Confirm that experiment pipelines consume strictly past information and that any deliberate leakage immediately degrades performance.

## What Was Done
- **Placebo probes** (`scripts/audit/leakage_probes.py`) generated paired runs stored under `results/leakage_control_*` and `results/leakage_placebo_*`. The consolidated comparison in `docs/audit/phase-2/leakage_probe_summary.csv` shows stability correlations collapsing from ~0.95 to ~0.14 once future data is shuffled, validating the sensitivity of the metrics to leakage.
- **Walk-forward verification** (`scripts/audit/check_walk_forward.py`) replays the scenario with truncated history and compares metrics at the shared pivot. The resulting `docs/audit/phase-2/walk_forward_check.csv` reports zero deltas across every metric, proving the implementation never reads beyond the available window.
- Scenario loading sorts and normalises timestamps (`training/run_scenario.py:120-156`), and every run now emits a `data_manifest.json` with dataset hash and creation timestamp, allowing deterministic reruns.

## Evidence
- `docs/audit/phase-2/leakage_probe_summary.csv` - control vs. placebo metrics and deltas.
- `docs/audit/phase-2/walk_forward_check.csv` - pivot comparison demonstrating monotone, past-only windows.
- `results/aggregate/comparison_summary.csv` - aggregates placebo degradation with recorded Git commit hashes for traceability.

## Outcome
Acceptance criteria met: placebo tests degrade metrics significantly, and walk-forward verification confirms strictly past-only processing with monotone indices. Phase 2 is **completed**.
