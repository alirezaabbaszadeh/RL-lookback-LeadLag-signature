# Phase 11 - Data Governance and Security (Completed 2025-10-19)

## Controls Implemented
- **PII and secrets**: Repository-wide search confirms no secrets or credentials; configuration values rely on YAML files committed in plain text with no tokens. Optional environment variables are documented only in local `.env` templates.
- **Dataset manifests**: Every run writes `data_manifest.json` via `governance/dataset.py`, recording path, SHA-256 hash, time coverage, asset list, and missing-value ratio. Manifests live next to each run directory (`results/**/data_manifest.json`). The manifest path is also referenced in `run_metadata.json` and Kaggle deployment docs.
- **Automated audit**: `scripts/audit/dataset_quality.py` scans CSV inputs for duplicates, missing data, and zero-variance columns. The script is part of the release checklist and exits non-zero on failure.
- **Access policy**: `docs/deployment/kaggle_setup.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` require datasets to be staged via Kaggle inputs or synthetic samples. Any private feeds must be hashed and referenced in manifests; raw confidential data is excluded from the repository.
- **Logs and observability**: Structured logging (`reporting/logging_utils.py`) enriches records with context (module, run_name, seed), making access audits and anomaly tracing straightforward.

## Evidence
- Sample manifest: `results/leakage_control_20251017_180832/data_manifest.json` (hash + missing ratios).
- Dataset audit CLI output (clean run) saved during smoke validation.
- README/Kaggle guide outlining controlled data ingress.

## Outcome
PII is absent, manifests and audit tooling are in place, and policies for dataset handling are documented. Phase 11 is **completed**.
