# Phase 12 - Paper Readiness and Packaging (Completed 2025-10-19)

## Rebuild Pipeline
- `reporting/generate_report.py` produces `reports/final_report.md`, `reports/final_report.pdf`, and `reports/appendix.md` in one invocation. The script consumes aggregated metrics, plots, and manifests to guarantee consistency.
- `scripts/smoke_kaggle.py` + `kaggle/starter.py` replicate the minimal scenario, meta-RL baseline, and offline RL baseline with deterministic seeds, ensuring figures/tables can be regenerated in cloud notebooks as well as locally.

## Determinism
- All configs pin seeds (`run.seed`) and capture Git/dataset metadata (`run_metadata.json` + `data_manifest.json`).
- `requirements-kaggle.txt` provides a frozen dependency set for reproducing plots and tables without optional extras.

## Documentation
- README quick start, `docs/deployment/kaggle_setup.md`, and `docs/repro.md` collectively describe the one-command build and validation steps (dataset audit → smoke tests → report generation).
- Limitations and governance considerations are recorded in Phase 10/11 reports and reflected in the final report narrative.

## Outcome
Artifacts can be rebuilt deterministically with a single command sequence, and supporting documentation is complete. Phase 12 is **completed**.
